        I, <a id="intro" href ="introduction.html"> Tilahun Sema </a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2020 WEB115 Web Markup and Scripting class with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.
      </p>

      <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
      </p>
      <p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.</p>
